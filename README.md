Old Java project from Sophomore year of high school.

From March 22, 2012 (spring semester of sophomore year of high school). Class was "MSTC Computer Science 2" which came after freshman year's "MSTC Computer Science 1" (a vamped up version of the normal "AP Computer Science" course for those outside of the MSTC program. If I remember correctly, for this project, we had to create our own "IMDB" (that online movie database) from scratch. One of the main end goals/learning outcomes was supposed to be "understanding how to cross-reference data structures."
